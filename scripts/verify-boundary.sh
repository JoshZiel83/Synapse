# verify:boundary — the single must-run gate for the DB / DTO / Wire boundary
# refactor (docs/architecture-boundary-refactor-master-plan.md). The root
# `npm test` / `npm run typecheck` only cover packages/api, and mobile-app is
# not even in the root workspace — so "root build is green" never meant the
# boundary-refactor clients + protocol packages were safe (round-6 P2-3). This
# script closes that gap: it builds the dependency chain, runs every boundary
# guard + the business-enum audit, and typechecks/tests every package that
# carries a piece of the boundary contract (API, shared, device-protocol,
# device-sdk, device-runtime, remote-agent-daemon, web-next, mobile-app).
#
# Usage: npm run verify:boundary   (from repo root)
#
# Exits non-zero on the first failing step. Set VERIFY_SKIP_TESTS=1 to run only
# the build + guard + typecheck layers (faster pre-commit gate).

# --require-all because the host tree is a full install. Version-agnostic: no patch
# filename, package or marker symbol appears here.

# for an artifact — that is exactly how an unpatched api image shipped while this
